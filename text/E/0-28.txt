Destroying these olive trees harms the farmers They spend their lives taking care of these trees and then someone just sets them on fire This tree is the same as those It is more than 80 years old It used to give us 30 kilos of olive oil each year Hundreds of trees have been cut down and set on fire Settlers pass by at any time and cut down and burn our trees as if the trees were their enemy These trees are our source of living Many have lost their olive trees The settlers cut them down and stole the olives Sometimes they even enter our village and attack people They once opened fire on a house with people inside We couldn't defend ourselves No one confronts those settlers There is nothing we can do Settlers come here backed up by soldiers
