DR ILAN PAPPE ISRAELI HISTORIAN Palestinian society was leaderless in many ways both militarily and politically And although there was a Palestinian leadership in exile it had very loose connections to the events inside Palestine So I think it is fair to say that from the 1939 onwards there isn't a real Palestinian leadership on the ground and this is one of the reasons that contributed to what happened in 1948
