I came here completely alone, not knowing anybody. 
   I decided in my final year of school, I have studied acting and theater. 
I felt that I have no room in the Israeli cultural swamp, I call it. 
 I chose Berlin because it is the most comfortable place for me to be right now. 
 My parents they really support me and they supported this decision as well. 
 But it was an issue for my mother's side, her parents had been through the war. 
 The thing she asks me most of the time;   -If you have a German boyfriend, before getting married or something, ask him where his grandparents were during the war! 
 It is some kind of black humor.
