There are a lot of things which are wrong in Israel. 
The current government is mainly consisted of right wing nationalist ultra-orthodox. 
People are not satisfied by this government, people are afraid of the actions and of the choices of this government And maybe we will have to deal with yet another war. 
 So it is one of the factors but I am not sure if this is the only reason why people chose to leave a country and go abroad.
