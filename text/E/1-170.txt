But I was there videoing in Bilin and Ashraf wouldn't sit with the protests to reach the wall, Ashraf was there for few minutes and he went to the back because Ashraf on a counter was brutally assaulted at Qalandia checkpoint he is got a serious and left him seriously impaired and we were concerned that the sounds bombs, his ear will be seriously damaged, even more. So Ashraf at the duration of the protest, sit on the hillside looking at the action, there was some stone throwing and in the end of the protests some Jeeps come in and Ashraf went up to them there was some verbals or whatever was arrested. He is fearless, he is brave, he is driven by deep anger as well against the occupation, the damage that the occupation has done to his family and he is fearless, like to the point of discussion which is sometimes is the better part of the battle.
