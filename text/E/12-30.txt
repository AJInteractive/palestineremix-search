The army is really maturing, it is really helping. 
But it is also, you know, you have strict rules and people telling you what to do. 
So the actually going to this trip alone, for me, it was really, meaningful, you know. 
Because Naturally I am kind of shy, so India kind of helped me to overcome this stuff in me. 
 The deeper you go into your soul, the stronger your relationship with God.
