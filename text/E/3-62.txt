I felt I always wanted to do something. 
I wanted to get re-acquainted with the people and places I knew. 
 Especially those which reminded me of my resistance, my teenage years and my childhood. 
 I wanted to see those places: the beach, the river, the valleys and the trees. 
I wanted to see these places again.
