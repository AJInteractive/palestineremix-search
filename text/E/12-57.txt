I did not like that Its like I feel that each one has the right to choose if he wants to hold a gun or not I did not want And when I went there they basically saw that I am a lone girl Which s a person who's family is not there So the army needs to provide me with an apartment money they need to take care of me They become my parents in Israel So I guess that they didn't like it which was for my luck
