What we learn in history in school is something like that;this was a land without people for a people without a land. That Israel was an uninhabited country. There is no word about the violence in the act of coming to an inhabited country, and saying that, I'm going to start my own state here. SHAHAR LEVI, FORMER SERGEANT.
