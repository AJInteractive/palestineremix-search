I can recognize if I sit in a place in India I can recognize  if it is a fresh, just finished the army, or maybe three years after and still traveling. 
They are always like in their little bubble of protection. 
Still. 
 They are still soldiers. 
Without uniforms. 
I did not want to serve, all my life. 
I always said that I don't want to be a soldier. 
It is so young. 
18. 
You go as a woman for two years, between 18 and 20. 
And for me it is kind of blocking your view and makes everybody same. 
 Think same, dress same, talk same. 
And there is the reality of like you have to. 
Who do you think you are not to serve? 
I did not like that. 
Its like I feel that each one has the right to choose if he wants to hold a gun or not. 
I did not want. 
And when I went there they basically saw that I am a lone girl. 
 Which s a person who's family is not there. 
So the army needs to provide me with an apartment, money, they need to take care of me. 
They become my parents in Israel. 
So I guess that they didn't like it, which was for my luck.  	  	                               	  	  	  YAELI FREESPIRIT   FORMER OFFICER.
