Most pilgrims spend 10 12 days in the Holy Land If they waste three nights in Eilat plus two days travel what do they miss as a result? STEPHEN SIZER Sadly I've seen pilgrimages that offer an opportunity to visit a settlement near Hebron where you can for the day you can pretend to be a member of the IDF and you engage in mock conflict where they've built a little Palestinian village and you can go in and take out terrorists This kind of commercial militaristic element of tourism is very worrying because it perpetuates this notion that the Palestinians are the enemy rather than our brothers and sisters The pilgrimage routes differ from one Christian denomination to another This map shows the itinerary of most pre arranged pilgrimage tours today They exclude the north of the West Bank The harsh reality of life in for example Jesus' birthplace Bethlehem is very different from its traditional biblical image
