A deaf young man came to me asking for my daughter's hand. I was against making one deaf person marry another. I eventually agreed but his mother refused. Then my son told me he wanted to marry a deaf girl. He wanted to be with her because they understand each other. So I'd been against it at first but because my daughter had been in this same situation I changed my mind and let my son marry a deaf woman. KHADER ALRANTISI PREACHER FOR THE DEAF.
