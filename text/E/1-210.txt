In Ni'lin in 2008 I think, it was a 10-year-old boy Ahmad Mousa, he was running away from the army and the jeep shot him, shot him dead into the head, his brain has fell out, the people carried Ahmad they vomited, the poor boy destroyed. The following day, in his burial, they killed another 19-year-old during protest here and they opened up on the shabab and they killed four or five days later I videoed both the burials, terrible stuff, you will wipe like a child. 
This is what they Israelis do, this is when they use white phosphorous horrifically weapon called Dime against the Palestinians you know in a cage or a prison called Gaza. 
When Palestinians in the west bank went for solidarity, they are just wiped out, murdered, killed. 
That's why I'm here, I'm driven by a deep sense of anger and outrage of what been perpetrates on the Palestinians, you know I've seen a tragedy with the Jewish people, that the Jewish suffered from the holocaust by Nazis, and what they are doing now
