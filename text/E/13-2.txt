It's a vibrant community full of strong personalities, many of whom we'll meet in this film, in their daily lives like Nura, a young student recently engaged to another deaf young man, Raed. Maysaa, a student who works part time at a restaurant staffed by deaf people and Hoda and Ashraf, a deaf couple with a hearing child, Farah. Mahmoud is a painter whose vision is also impaired.
