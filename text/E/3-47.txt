I was sleeping. 
One of the prisoners woke me up. 
He tried to make sure I was alert enough to listen to what he was going to say. 
 He told me Arabic and Hebrew TV reports were saying they were going to release me. 
I couldn't believe it. 
We didn't sleep that night. 
There had been similar reports before but I hadn't been released.
