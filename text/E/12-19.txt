We decided to refuse as a group and we declared that we will refuse publicly.  We said "our reasons to refuse are because we know what is happening on in the Occupation, we have seen this and we can't be a part of that system. 
 I was probably sentenced six or seven times, altogether for about two months in military prison  And another three months in detention  And eventually I was released on mental health. 
 So technically I am crazy.
