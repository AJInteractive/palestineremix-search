I was unemployed for three years. I tried to get work in government offices. I was very frustrated and angry. I really wanted to work and was patient, year after year. I kept on sending applications and eventually, I got the chance to work at the Ministry of Finance. I'm the only deaf person working here, even though five per cent of the workforce should be disabled.
