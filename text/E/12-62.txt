Yeah, only like in the army did I come to bigger conclusions and got my opinion a bit stronger about Israel itself, about living here, if I want to live there, why I don't want live there, why I shouldn't live there. 
 For me here, it is quiet. 
I don't deal with news, another terrorist was killed, another bomb went off, another Qassam fell, another soldier was kidnapped, this politician was found corrupt againthis one did that  I don't have that right now in my life and that's a lot better for me, that's quiet for me.
