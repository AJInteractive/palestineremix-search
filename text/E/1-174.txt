I don't know how many times I was injured or arrested, dozens of times, I don't know, never anything too serious, the longest into prison is 3 months I was fortunate enough to not have to spend long period. 
The most serious injury was to the head, I was shot in the head with ____ projector, few internal brain hemorrhage I was very lucky in fact
