One of the goals of the stuff we are hearing about, it is really horrible stuff. 
It is to push Palestinians out of this area. 
It is happening now. 
And the thought I just had here while he was saying  was that if you go see museums of ethnic atrocities elsewhere and they will say, never again, and this sort of business. 
 But it is happening now, we are standing here now, it is not a museum.
