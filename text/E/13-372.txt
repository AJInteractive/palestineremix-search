[Ahmad Abu Matar]  I've come out to see and talk to you. 
I'm glad we're together. 
 Alaa:   Gaza is under blockade. 
The situation's very hard. 
 Power cuts last eight hours. 
 This blockade strangles us. 
There's no gas for cooking. 
 We're really exhausted. 
 We waste a lot of time waiting and travelling without proper transport.
