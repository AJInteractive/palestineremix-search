Five years ago a demonstration was organised by the Palestinians in Qana valley I asked the Israeli forces to clear the road for us but they wanted us to withdraw I had a row with them and they told me to put my hands up Instead I threw stones at them I was handcuffed and put on the ground by four soldiers
