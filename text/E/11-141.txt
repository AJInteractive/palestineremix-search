My name is Frank Hughes I come from the Belfast to Gaza crew This vehicle is going to be donated to the James Connoughly surgical unit at the Al Auda hospital in Gaza The money that we used are donated from the North of West Belfast and the North of Ireland or the occupied six counties as it is sometimes referred to The hospital specifically requested for a mini bus with wheelchair access So there are different typrd of medical aid going to Gaza on this medical convoy from all over the world People sometimes ask why seven men from Ireland would drive for four weeks to drive four thousand miles for complete strangers to go into a foreign country for people who don't even share the same religion the same culture the same language All I can say is the oppression suffered by the people in Palestine is exactly the same that happened in Ireland 150 years from British tyrannical empirical rule For eight hundred years the people of Ireland have resisted foreign occupation We feel very very passionately and strongly the pain of the Palestinian people
