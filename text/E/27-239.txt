Of course there are security concerns But the way the policy works is not about security concerns We were representing five women who were trying to reach Birzeit for their studies Most of them were women’s’ rights activists who were trying to reach gender studies and human rights at Birzeit university in the West Bank In some cases two of those women have been given permits for two reasons One for medical care and another for a three day conference But they weren’t allowed to stay in the west bank for the months necessary to complete their degree So if there were a security claim against them they would not have been allowed to travel to enter Israel and the west bank So if a person is allowed to do that for a three day conference There’s no security reason not to allow her to stay and complete a degree Unless what you’re trying to do is to prevent long term ties between Gaza and the west bank as a way of separating the two territories
