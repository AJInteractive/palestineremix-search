At that time I was a peace activist There was a very big peace camp and I remember that one morning people from the Israeli army came to speak with us and said look we don't want to we really support your peace camp but we want to make the ground flat in order to build the wall so you have to take your peace camp a few km away because we have to straighten the land for the wall
