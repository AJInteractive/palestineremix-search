The doctors didn't let me see Jawaher I went back home There were a lot of people there I told them not to cry She is a martyr I tried to hold myself together I prayed First I had lost Bassem and then Jawaher I can do nothing but pray to God Commenting on this incident Gideon Levy wrote an article entitled Lies of the Israeli Army on the 9th January 2011 The Israeli army issued several untruths about Jawaher's death They first said she had died from natural causes at home not in the hospital But that didn't work Then they came up with other lies They said she wasn't with the protesters They also claimed Jawaher was ill with cancer It's all lies
