A friend of mine bought a TV. 
He called me and said: 'I have a TV. 
You can change the channels as you are sitting on your chair. 
Come and see it'. 
 I went with another friend. 
We sat there and played with the remote control for more than six hours. 
 We changed channels and laughed. 
We then saw the video player. 
It was amazing. 
We watched a wedding video from a year earlier. 
We kept pausing and rewinding. 
We broke the video player to understand this technology. 
But we still don't.
