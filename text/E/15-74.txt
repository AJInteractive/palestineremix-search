URI SAVIR ISRAELI DIPLOMAT I'm a big believer in secret negotiations so at the end the public knows the outcome and not the intermediary concessions And therefore we knew we had about two three months and in three months we did it In this hotel near Oslo Uri Savir used his first meeting with the Palestinians to stress three deal breaking Israeli conditions First no negotiations over Jerusalem or the return of refugees Second no UN involvement or international arbitration
