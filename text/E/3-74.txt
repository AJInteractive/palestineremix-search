Everything was different when we were released. 
Even the morning greetings. 
 In prison we'd just say: 'Good morning'. 
 Now, you're expected to ask: 'How are you? 
What's up?' 
 There was no need to ask that in prison because we were together all the time. 
We just said 'Good morning' and 'Good night'.
