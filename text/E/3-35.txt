One day I asked to speak to Alfred. 
 He asked me: 'What do you want?' 
 I said: 'I see you here for 24 hours. 
You then leave for 24 hours and come back the third day.' 
 He replied: 'So what?' 
 I said: 'This means if I stay in jail for 20 years, you will stay here for 10.' 
 He said: 'But I'm being paid for it.' 
 I said: 'But I eat, drink and sleep for free. 
And you are staying with me here.' 
 He got upset and sent me to solitary confinement for two days.
