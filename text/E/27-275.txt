I donâ€™t need secret documents to see that since 91 when the world was expecting to have a solution of two states based on UN resolutions Israel did everything possible to foil these solutions Disconnecting settlements fragmenting the area in the west bank Disconnecting east Jerusalem from the west bank These were the policies This fragmentation actually if you look at it from an architectural point of view is very similar to what Israel is doing in Israel What Israeli authorities are doing to Palestinians in Israel Palestinians live in disconnected enclaves the land has been taken from most of them So they are more and more crammed in this is very similar to the reality of the enclaves that Israel imposes on Palestinians in the west bank Gaza became now the biggest enclave but it has the most draconian restrictions on movement In the West Bank you still have some illusion of freedom of movement But of course any moment the Israelis can block you from going one enclave to another
