My personal experience was very formative in my choice not to serve in the Israeli military. And that was that a friend of mine was killed, he was Palestinian. He was murdered on October 2000 while demonstrating. And that helped me to realize, to open my eyes and realize that in the name of security, my security, supposedly, terrible things are being done.
