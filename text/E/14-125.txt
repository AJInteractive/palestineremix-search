HANS LONGVA NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT Before the Gulf war PLO received big financial support from the Arab gulf states After the war because of Yasser Arafat's support to Saddam Hussein that financial support disappeared They came out of that war very weakened And I think frankly that was also one of the reasons why the Israelis were more interested in discussing with them after the Gulf war than before We of course have close relations with the United States of America They are an ally they are a friend and we made no secret of the contacts with the PLO obviously and we shared some of our assessment based on our communication with PLO with our American friends yes
