Levy During the intifada I once arrived at a checkpoint near Jenin I saw a Palestinian ambulance with its lights flashing I waited for more than 40 minutes and then couldn't stay silent I got out of my car to see what was happening I saw the Israeli soldiers playing board games in a tent I shouted at them They got angry when I told them to imagine it was their father in that ambulance dying while they played Israelis hate it when you ask them to imagine themselves in the Palestinians' place They were so angry they pointed their guns at me
