SUHEIL DIAB FORMER SPOKESMAN NAZARETH MUNICIPALITY Nazareth is a nuisance for the Israeli government They can't erase its existence They couldn't do it after Al Nakba in 1948 for International and historical reasons On the other hand they want to reduce the city's status In 1956 they established a big Jewish city which they later called Nazaret Illit to marginalise the Palestinian city of Nazareth and make it a small district of the extended Jewish city They aim to turn Nazareth into a very quick pilgrimage visit
