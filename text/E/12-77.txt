The dissatisfaction levels are growing tremendously in Israel. 
The demonstrations in the last summer and what is coming this summer. 
Are showing that especially the middle class, a huge group, is very discontent with the situation. 
If this discontent will transform in emigration rates... we have to see. 
 It will depend on the situation in Europe, in the United States. 
Certainly they are not going to immigrate to the Third World. 
And we can't say for sure what will happen; one of the scenarios is that there will be an exodus.
