Dr Mahdi Abdul Hadi Glubb Pasha adhered to this agreement and ordered his forces to evacuate the cities of Lod and Ramleh On July the 10th the Jordanian forces pulled out of Lod and Ramleh Clear of Jordanian forces the two cities were bombed by what was now the Israeli air force The Israeli army then moved in commanded by Colonel Moshe Dayan In Lod alone over 100 Palestinians were massacred inside the Dahmash mosque More than 50 000 Palestinians were expelled from the two cities Walking without provisions in the summer heat many died of exhaustion in what has since become known as the ‘Lydda Death March’ Despite the presence of the Arab forces in Palestine atrocities were still committed Yet few are well documented Israeli historian Theodor Katz submitted a thesis claiming the Israelis had committed a massacre in the coastal village of Tantura “They closed all the four sides of Tant o said that my rifle is somewhere next to my house was taken like this with a rope to his house by two or four people and the next thing was that the rifle came out and the man did not And those who answered there on the beach that they had no rifle were directly shot in their head Now this is not a Palestinian story This is a story of a Jew who was a lawyer in the state of Israel many years The Palestinian men of Tantoura were taken to the cemetery and there they were put in lines and they were told to begin digging and whenever a line finished digging they were shot and fell down inside ” “There was no worry on the Zionist leadership’s side that the soldiers would fail to understand what was expected of them because they had already dehumanized the Palestinians in their thinking and perception long before the operations themselves began ” The state of Israel was formed through blood and fire yet this was neither the start nor the end of suffering for the Palestinians
