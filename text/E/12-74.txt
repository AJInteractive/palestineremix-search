It is too stressful there. 
And when I say stressful I don't mean like in a war zone kind of stressful way. 
 I didn't feel the war zone so much and I on purpose detached myself from any kind of political  I don't read papers I don't watch television. 
It is the only way for me to be there, I cannot stand it any other way. 
 And even though, the stress of the society is in every level of being.
