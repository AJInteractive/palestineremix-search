Ordinary people, even intelligent people with high self-awareness, become, In a way, monsters in this distorted reality. 
 But you know, you grow older, and you start thinking about those things. 
Not only about those incidents. 
 You start to think about the other. 
The other, the Palestinian andTheir needs and their motives.
