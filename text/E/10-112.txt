I once passed the site of my old primary school It had been demolished It was a beautiful building I asked why it had been demolished They wanted to expand the car parking for the vegetable market They don't want to leave a trace of Palestinian heritage Under the pretext of development the Israelis put up modern western style government buildings near Haifa port They wanted to westernise the architecture of the city to make the Arab inhabitants feel like they were not at home These modern buildings were put up among what remained of the old Arab homes They made Haifa more like Tel Aviv When a visitor arrives in Haifa they feel it's a modern Israeli city with a few Arab features here and there Haifa has become an Israeli city with few Arab residents
