You can't be a passenger in life for whatever, you can't be a couch potato or an observer when you have to feel deeply about something major injustice like what have been portrayed on Palestine you have to do it or else you die inside, you can't when you began to make an excuses, I intend to go longer and that I did act in my conscience and came here, and you know getting stronger as such with my commitment is just total, like I just live Palestine and Ireland. 
You know I'm 64 now but I discovered, not self esteem, but like self confidence and like something strong inside me, I realize this and I feel good with that
