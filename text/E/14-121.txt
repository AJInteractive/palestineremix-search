I was involved with talking to the Palestinian side for many years in a very informal way mainly with people like Hanan Ashrawi and Faisal Husseini from east Jerusalem with whom it was easy to talk By 1989 with the Palestinian intifada in its second year there were few signs of hope for peace Hundreds of Palestinians had been killed and thousands detained The United States under President George Bush started to increase the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
