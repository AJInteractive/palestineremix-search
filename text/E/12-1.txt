Those who take should also give. Jews have only one homeland. If we don't help ourselves who will help us? Those who refuse to serve in the army haven't been well-raised by their families. Otherwise, they would serve their homeland. What does our country give us in return? 1% off from your bank loan? You should escape when asked to serve. All our children must serve in the army. It's irresponsible to refuse to serve. You can't live here without serving. AVNER GVARYAHU ING THE SILENCE.
