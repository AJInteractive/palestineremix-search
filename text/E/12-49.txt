At the time we came to India, it was at the time that Israel just starting to build the wall. 
 We were feeling that this was the opportunity to get out of the country. 
 At that time I was a peace activist. 
There was a very big peace camp. 
 I remember that one morning people from the Israeli army came to speak with us and said - look, we don't want towe really support your peace camp,  But we want to make the ground flat in order to to build the wall, so you have to take your peace camp a few km away because we have to straighten the land for the wall. 
 For me it was a very big understanding that after they build the wall it is not going to get any better, now it would take years to break it.
