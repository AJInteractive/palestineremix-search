Dr Ilan Pappe There is a new Nakba taking place as we talk It just doesn't have the same features and characteristics of the 1948 Nakba The 1948 Nakba was in one period of time very dramatic and massive The present Nakba is a very slow process of expulsion annexation demolishing of houses and imprisonment of people It is going on for 40 years It is in a way it's a new version of the same idea of how to cause the Palestinians to leave Palestine
