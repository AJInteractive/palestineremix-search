Dr Ilan Pappe Orde Wingate was very racist towards the Arabs During his role as a British army officer in the Arab revolt that he decided to include Jewish soldiers in his units and he taught them how to occupy Palestinian villages expel them destroy them And I think in many ways he contributed directly to the ideas of ethnic cleansing that would be perpetrated on the ground in 1948
