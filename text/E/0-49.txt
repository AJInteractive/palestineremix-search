I have no problem with criticism Constructive criticism against Israel Its policies and settlements The occupation That is fine But to describe a state as a monster That is not criticism t's denying its legitimacy In this way you are reducing the chances for reaching peace Peace can't be reached with the devil You simply have to get rid of this devil because it is dangerous and it commits crimes against humanity And it doesn't deserve to exist Gideon Levy is not criticising Israel He is portraying it as the devil and that's very dangerous
