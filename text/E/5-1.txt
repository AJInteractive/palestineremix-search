We will cut off the power No we can't manage There is nothing I can do Get a generator It is your turn Our kids want to study And we are making bread That is my work It is out of my hands What can we do now? I can't do anything That is my job Would you accept me cutting off the power if you were baking? Never My children can't study We can't wash our clothes I can't do anything Even if I quit my job they will replace me with someone else Don't quit your job But try to do something for us
