I was born here in Qana Valley My grandfather died here aged 85 My father also died here aged 80 I'm now 85 and I want to die in this valley The Israelis put up a sign declaring this valley a nature reserve We didn't know what it meant at the time but we're not allowed to farm here This area belongs to my cousin Whenever we plant here the Israelis destroy it But we won't give up
