I guess the soldiers like the vast majorities of Israelis society sees the people who come here, Israelis who come here as traitors, and to a degree I think, they are right, because we betray the notion that this place here is part of Israel, that Israelis are better than Palestinians, that Israelis deserve more rights and better security that Palestinians here, than Palestinians inside Israel, than refugees. 
So to that degree, they are correct, we are traitors and I'm very proud to portray this culture
