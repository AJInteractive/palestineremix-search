The nightmares are fewer now. 
 The bad experience no longer affects us. 
I did my best to free myself from the past. 
 I view it as a period of time that has passed. 
I need to be reconciled with my past. 
 I had difficulties at that time. 
But I also benefitted from them. 
I developed a strong character to face the prison guards and the harsh conditions. 
 That's success in its own right.
