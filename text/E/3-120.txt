I think recognizing Israel and it's recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation is a crime. 
 We have the right to liberate Palestine. 
We don't only want parts of the West Bank. 
We demand the land beyond the 1967 border. 
But unfortunately, even a third world war won't remove those settlements. 
Only the resistance can do that.
