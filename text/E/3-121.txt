A gull gets lost at night   A boat gets lost at night   I hear steps of a woman at night   Oh, night woman I fought with a defeated army   I didn't like the starless night   Our leaders shook hands with the enemy while we were fighting   We saw them with the other army   I'll now look for another aim maybe to rent a boat The night seems long when we spend it with the defeated army
