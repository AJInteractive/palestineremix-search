Dror Etkes Researcher and activist against the Israeli occupation I would say generally that the West Bank has become a jungle or if you wish a haven for construction criminals people who feel like taking the land of the neighbour just have to wake up one day with enough energy and decide to grab the land of the neighbour In most cases if you're stubborn enough this is what will happen eventually and the Israeli authorities will eventually back them If the state of Israel will enforce law as it should I mean at the end of the day this is what a state supposed to do noto enforce law if the Israeli state will force law on Israeli settlers living them that means much less land would be available
