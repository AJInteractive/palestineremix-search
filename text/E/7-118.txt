Vangelis Pissias You can't imagine those children's eyes looking at you from the water they jumped into the sea and were swimming towards the boat It's a scene one can never imagine It's a scene that once you see you'll never forget it I will never forget it for the rest of my life There was one child in particular The captain shouted at me to tell the children to stay clear in case the propeller hit them So I shouted 'Watch out It's a dangerous ' And that child just looked at me and laughed with his friends and he shouted back 'There's no danger in Palestine'
