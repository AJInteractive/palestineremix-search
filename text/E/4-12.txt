STEPHEN SIZER The Israeli government clearly has an agenda to portray an Israeli script of the holy land They will visit historical sites associated with the conquest of Palestine by the Israelites and perhaps a few locations that will help re enforce Israel's insecurity or its need for the land that has been stolen from the Palestinians When you go to somewhere like Yad Vashem for example an Israeli guide will say look what the Germans did to the Jewish people now you understand why we need security And often a visit to Yad Vashem will take place on the first day of the tour so that the group is traumatized and will be silenced from criticising Israel
