Unfortunately, in our societies people put on different masks. 
 They have a different personality when dealing with others than when they deal with themselves. 
 In prison it is hard to wear any mask. 
 Eventually you return to the real 'you'. 
Because you are in the same place all the time. 
All masks drop.
