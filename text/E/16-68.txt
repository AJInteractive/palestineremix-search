Pat Sheehan As a hunger strike went on and Bobby then dies a number of other prisoners died I was called on to replace Kieran Doherty who died in early August of 1981 and I commenced my hunger strike on the 10th of August And I was on hunger strike for the next 55 days until the 3rd of October when it was decided that the hunger strike would end So I was quite fortunate that I survived it In fact four days before the end of the hunger strike I had been examined by a consultant from one of the main hospitals here in Belfast and he told me that even if I ended my hunger strike there and then there was a good chance I wouldn't survive because my liver was beginning to shut down and there was a change that there may have been irreplable damage done to it But as you can see I survived I was very lucky to survive Probably in another 48 hours and I would have been dead
