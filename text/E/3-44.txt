My family thought I looked the same as when I was 18. 
 I couldn't believe how different they looked when I received their pictures. 
 It wasn't until 1995, eight years after I was jailed, when they allowed us to receive videotapes from our families. 
It was only then I started to have a new image of my family in my mind.
