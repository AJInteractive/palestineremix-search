One break time they opened the doors of the cells. 
One of the prisoners was a blind man called Mahmoud Danhash. 
He'd lost his sight when injured in a battle. 
A guard asked Mahmoud to make his bed before leaving his cell. 
We had to do this before going out. 
Mahmoud's sheets weren't arranged very well. 
He was blind. 
I told the guard it was fine I, but he insisted he do it better. 
I got furious and slapped the guard. 
He fell. 
He then blew his whistle to call the alert.
