Suhail One of the 10 power lines coming from the Israeli side has been cut for eight days We've contacted them but they haven't fixed it Sometimes we have difficulty getting fuel for the power station They give us only enough fuel to operate two units while the third remains out of action We also have problems getting spare parts The Israeli side causes all these problems on top of the occupation they make our lives more difficult
