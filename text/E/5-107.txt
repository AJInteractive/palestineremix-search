Kanaan If Egypt were to feed Gaza with power we would be talking about a very small amount in terms of power Gaza may need 600 megawatts by 2030 This is relatively tiny Egypt consumes 27 000 megawatts The 300 that Gaza needs is about 1 per cent of Egypt's consumption This 1 per cent would hardly affect Egypt's own power supply
