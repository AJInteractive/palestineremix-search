My husband and I took turns to look after our first baby I slept while he stayed awake watching her I went to work and when I came home I would sleep My husband helps me at night When he's awake I sleep He helps me when our daughter wakes up and cries He brings her to me for breast feeding and then she goes back to sleep This is how we lived until she grew up We taught her sign language letters as well as lip reading
