Most of us were young when we were jailed. 
 We knew nothing about politics. 
 Except for some who were affiliated with certain parties. 
Some were Communists. 
Some belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Others were Liberals. 
Those who understood politics taught us. 
They made us see how knowledge enables man to endure.
