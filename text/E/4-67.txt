ATALLAH HANNA There was another incident at the Monastery of Latrun They used graffiti and also burned part of the monastery If it wasn't for the vigilance of the priests one morning the whole monastery would have burned down Thank God there were no casualties But so far we've heard of no arrests for those crimes MILATIOS BASAL Who protected the church I was in charge of? Our Muslim neighbours A man and a woman stood together They guarded the door and prevented an attack on the church Those protecting churches are now our countrymen Then there is Holy Saturday at Easter The yard of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre becomes a military barracks Even priests aren't allowed to move freely
