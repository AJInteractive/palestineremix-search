Unless you are willing to be an active participant, an activist in Israel, willing to jeopardize your health and maybe sacrifice your life, for the sake of actively standing in Israel and refusing and fighting the Occupation, unless you are willing to take that responsibility on yourself, get the fuck out of there now, oppose it from afar, hold our breaths, say we don't like and disagree with all these stupid ideas that will come to flourishing. 
 Wait 200 years and then talk again. 
 [Gabriel S. Moses]
