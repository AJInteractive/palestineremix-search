I was in the war with the Gaza Strip. 
The first couple of months I find myself not sleeping, nightmares all the time, stress all the time. 
But if you really start to think about things too much, then you just start being sad you knowYou just fall down in this cycle and after that it is really hard to pick yourself up and go out, especially if you have to function as a soldier, you know, in the end. 
 So you just wake up, you look at what you have, you smile. 
Maybe sometimes you say, not thank God because I don't believe in that guy,  Maybe sometimes you say maybe thank you that I am not on the other side of the fence, of the weapon of the binoculars, whatever.
