People cannot go to study in Birzeit I mean people from Rafah young students whose studies were cut in the middle because they did not get a permit I remember very well gazans telling when they went by all kinds of crazy ways to the west bank they went to finish their studies so they could not come for three years to see their parents because they could not depend on permits You might get a permit to Gaza but you might not get a permit to go back to the west bank So they remained in the west bank for years and when they departed from their parents in the Gaza strip their parents cried Their mothers and sisters cried as if they were going to the moon I remember one said to his mom ‘why are you crying I’m not going to Saudi Arabia ’ He went to birzeit from Rafah The mother said ‘you’re going much further away than Saudi Arabia’
