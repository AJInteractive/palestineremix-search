There was one incident that didn't let me go, in a way. 
I couldn't really sleep at night. There was like a group of terrorist that broken to one of those checkpoints and they killed the Israeli soldiers. 
 We didn't care about the motive. 
 -Oh yeah, we are going to kill people, that's cool  So we went there and there were a few people in like uniforms, but the other people were not in uniforms, so you can never tell if they are soldiers or  Policemen, or just friends who came to visitBut the task was to terminate them. 
And that's what we did.
