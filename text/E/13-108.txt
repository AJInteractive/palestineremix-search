[HODA SHAHEEN] I was in love with Ashraf before he proposed. I kept on seeing him. I was excited and I wanted to get engaged to him. We got married but our life was very hard. We've been patient. We've carried on like this. We communicate normally with people. They think the deaf are stupid but we're normal. Our neighbours and everyone else help us.
