I did not want to serve, all my life. I always said that I don't want to be a soldier. It is so young. 18. You go as a woman for two years, between 18 and 20. And for me it is kind of blocking your view and makes everybody same. Think same, dress same, talk same. And there is the reality of like you have to. Who do you think you are not to serve?
