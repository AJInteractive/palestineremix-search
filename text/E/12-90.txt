When we talk about Hebron we talk about the ghost town. 
We talk about the city that used to be probably the biggest market city probably all around Israel, which is now pretty much empty. 
 We talk about more than 1800 stores that were closed, shut down; most of them welded shut by the army.  [Avner Gvaryahu]
