I think that the importance of the phenomenon of backpacking in Israel is that it allows a number of groups of Israelis, particularly young Israelis, to consolidate some kind of identity and some kind of shared experiences and shared practices that are shared among this group but not with other group. For instance ultra-orthodox Jews don't backpack, Palestinians living in Israel, Muslims or Christians, they don't backpack, they do other things at that age. So the group of backpackers is a way to do something that is physically outside the country and to relate to each other.
