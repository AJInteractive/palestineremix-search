FADI QATTAN TOURIST AGENCY OWNER BETHLEHEM Bethlehem is a special place for me It embodies the culture of Palestine It's a message to the world both religious or cultural that we all live together in this land This belief runs in our family My parents and grandparents taught me to love Bethlehem The second great thing about Bethlehem which is very important to me is that it's the birthplace of the Lord Jesus I see Jesus as the first example of non violent resistance in the history of mankind
