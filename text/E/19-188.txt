I've come back to the United States to tell Jews in the United States how the state of Israel has been formed The Jews are holding their ground in the country in spite of the fact that they've been outnumbered by the Arabs and the Arabs have come much better equipped with heavy arms than the Jews have in their possesion The reason is a simple one Jews who are fighting in Palestine the state of Israel are fighting for the only thing they have in their possession It means life or death to them
