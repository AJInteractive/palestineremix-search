I was driving them when we reached a checkpoint The soldiers stopped me I asked them to let me pass to take my sister in law to the hospital They refused So I drove to another checkpoint but faced the same problem I went to the Ras Al Amood checkpoint It was getting very late The soldiers there also refused to let me pass When I returned to the car I discovered she had delivered the baby My mother told me to stop arguing with the soldiers She held the baby and walked with my sister in law to the hospital I returned home
