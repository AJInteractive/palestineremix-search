[Gal Skolnik] I had several reasons to leave Israel. One was kind of a more social reason. I mean in Israel the society is still pretty traditional. On the other hand it was the Lebanon war and I had a really hard time coping with that because when I lived in Israel I was kind of trying to totally ignore all the politics, I was doing my very best.
