The prison officials told me to prepare my belongings. 
This meant I was going to be freed. 
There were 40 cells in the section where I was held. 
I wanted to say goodbye to the other prisoners. 
So I asked the guard to open the doors of some of the cells and he did. 
I felt a change in the way they treated me even though I was freed against their will.
