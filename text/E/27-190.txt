We did a poll to try to get a sense of how many people from Gaza have relatives in Israel east Jerusalem and the west bank Areas that need permits in order to reach them for travel And we found that about a third of people living in Gaza have relatives either in the west bank Gaza or east Jerusalem So there’s a tremendous need to travel to see family members But the criteria are such that you could only travel in very exceptional humanitarian circumstances If your mother is very very ill you may get a permit Weddings are allowed Funerals are allowed for first degree relatives But if you want to see your mother because you haven’t seen her in 20 years that doesn’t count
