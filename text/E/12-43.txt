I was very proud of myself to go to the army, especially because I love the country. 
So I was like  I'm going to protect it, to do stuff for the country. 
 My job wasn't something very stressful because it was kind of fun. 
 I was in charge of the education in the base. 
But my soldiers they had a tough job. 
I had a boyfriend that was a fighter. 
 I know that my boyfriend didn't like fighting with other people. 
 He knows that they are innocent, most of the people there, but he has no choice, so	  	  [Hadas Perez]
