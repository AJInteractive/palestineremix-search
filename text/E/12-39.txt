I finished the army two years ago.  I wasn't really trying to achieve something in the army. 
I just went like wherever they put me. They put me like in a tank crew. 
The only time you can say that I was in a war it was in Gaza. I've been like five days. 
 It is not really like the movies or like you imagine it will be if you need to be in this kind of situation.  It is really really different and you are already into it and you are always preparing. 
 When it happens it just happens so quick you don't really  It's  long time since I've thought about this kind of stuff.  It was good and bad 'cause I have a lot of good memories from the army. 
 But also it was kind of hard times you know. 
Because you don't really do what you want to do. I don't like wars or I don't like this situation where you have to constantly protect your borders or feel intimidated you know. 
I prefer peace and happiness. 
You don't have a lot of choice in Israel. You know It's kind ofyou have to do it. 
Because it is really a big part of Israeli society.  [Chaim Noy]
