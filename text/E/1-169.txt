[10/04/2010] [Bil'in Village] [Donnellan] [English speaker] I maximize publicity by whatever the message by videoing, video the protest and broadcast them, so the message gets out fair and wide because the message of Palestine has to be broadcasted you know [Donnellan] [English speaker] In Ni'lin in 2008 I think, it was a 10-year-old boy Ahmad Mousa, he was running away from the army and the jeep shot him, shot him dead into the head, his brain has fell out, the people carried Ahmad they vomited, the poor boy destroyed. The following day, in his burial, they killed another 19-year-old during protest here and they opened up on the shabab and they killed four or five days later I videoed both the burials, terrible stuff, you will wipe like a child. When Palestinians in the west bank went for solidarity, they are just wiped out, murdered, killed.
