TOMER SAGEE FORMER SOLDIER I think what the army gave me was time to sit and learn a bit about myself and my abilities I don't take anything that the army taught me physically like military wise but I do take the years that I spent having to deal with myself as my main obstacle to overcome I chose to see it like that plain and simple Israel is a crazy experiment You try to create a reality where a modern country that is supposed to be like any European country but we are doing it in an environment that is not European and our mentality is not really European So 60 years is very little time to create a real identity and when you think that what really holds a country together is fearâ€¦ fear of not existing anymore then you kind of live in a mentality of I have to do things quick because maybe there is no tomorrow
