I think what the army gave me was time to sit and learn a bit about myself and my abilities. 
I don't take anything that the army taught me physically like military-wise, but I do take the years that I spent having to deal with myself as my main obstacle to overcome. 
I chose to see it like that, plain and simple.  	  Tomer Sagee
