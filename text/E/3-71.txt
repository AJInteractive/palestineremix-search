I haven't seen a penny in 12 years. 
In prison, they gave us food and tea. 
 Take it or leave it. 
They gave us four cigarettes every day. 
We didn't get to choose what brand of cigarette. 
But now, there is so much variety. 
A lot of fruit. 
Our families and the organisations we belong to give us money. 
But we don't know how to spend it.
