Vangelis Pissias This boat trip is not the first time I get to know the occupied territories of Palestine I've known them since 1996 Back then as an engineer and the coordinator of a European project I went there on many occasions and worked both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip We designed and built the first Palestinian Parliament in Ramallah When I met President Arafat my wish was to see the Palestinian Parliament move to its rightful location Jerusalem
