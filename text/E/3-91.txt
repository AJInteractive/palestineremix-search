We had little food in prison. 
So we used to hide some bread or tomatoes to eat them when we felt hungry. 
We all did so. 
 I still have the same habit. 
 I always tell my husband: 'We don't have sugar' or 'we don't have rice'. 
Even if we still have five kilos of each. 
He buys more even though he knows we still have a lot. 
He wants to keep me calm.
