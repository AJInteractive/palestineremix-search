Levy I can understand why a young man would carry out a suicide operation in Tel Aviv I think every suicide bomber who killed women and children would have preferred to sit in an air conditioned helicopter press a button and fire a rocket at Salah Shehada's house in Gaza To kill 15 children and a woman and still be viewed as innocent not a terrorist Terrorism is a weapon used by the weak It is a terrible weapon and I am completely against it But I understand where it comes from It comes from despair
