I come here because I believe that it is wrong that Israel built this thing, I think it's wrong that Israel built it at all, I think it's wrong that Israel has built it on people's land. 
I think separation is not a solution to what we have here and I think it definitely shouldn't come at the expense of the Palestinians and that's why I come here and participate in these demonstrations specifically in Elin, I was here in 2004, the first round of demonstrations right after demonstrations in Bedros began. 
The work is used of course to grab land and to allow the expansion of settlements but it's also used for unilateral redrawing of the border to unitarily decide where a future border if it is to announce that border its ever control over Palestinians or over the west bank, well I come from
