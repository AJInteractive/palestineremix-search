The number of Israelis in Berlin is increasing. 
It is very hard to know exactly how many are here because many have European passports, which was unthinkable maybe 10, 15 years ago. 
Even those who don't have passports. 
Many people simply come with their Israeli passport  They start to study German, they get some student visa and they can stay  I haven't heard about an Israeli that was expelled from Berlin.
